# Stacks Foundation Residency Program

Welcome to the Stacks Foundation Residency Program repository. This program funds subject matter experts for long-term research and development projects within the Stacks ecosystem.

## About the Program

The Residency Program supports in-depth work on research, tooling, and infrastructure that adds value to multiple Core Engineering Workstreams. Residents often work on projects that require deep exploration and contribute broadly to the Stacks community.

## How It Works

- Tailored proposals are invited from subject matter experts
- Projects typically last 6 to 12 months
- Thorough review process by Foundation staff and Core Engineering teams
- Monthly stipend with potential performance-based bonuses
- Regular progress reports and community engagement

## Get Involved

- Check the [Issues](../../issues) in this repository:
  - Open issues represent current resident projects
  - Closed issues are completed residencies or applications that were not approved
- If you're a subject matter expert interested in a long-term project, consider applying

## Important Note

- Applications submited through this repo by creating an issue will not be considered.

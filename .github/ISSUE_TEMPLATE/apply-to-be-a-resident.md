# Stacks Foundation Residency Program

Welcome to the Stacks Foundation Residency Program repository. This program funds subject matter experts for long-term research and development projects within the Stacks ecosystem.

## About the Program

The Residency Program supports in-depth work on research, tooling, and infrastructure that adds value to multiple Core Engineering Workstreams. Residents often work on projects that require deep exploration and contribute broadly to the Stacks community.

## Important Note

- Applications submited through this repo by creating an issue will not be considered.

## More Information

- If you would like to be considered for a Stacks Residency (or nominate some else - or suggest a type of SME we should consider for a Residency) please contact us at programs@stacks.org

We're excited to see how your expertise can contribute to the Stacks ecosystem!
